* Noteworthy changes in release 1.1 (2016-(01)Jan-01 UTC [hopefully]) [stable]

  sat does not use a daemon socket anymore,
  the actions of the commands are handled directly
  in the command rather than delegated. The daemon
  is let known via a SIGCHLD signal (not code added
  to satd, only removed.)


* Noteworthy changes in release 1.0 (2016-(01)Jan-01 UTC) [stable]

  Initial release.
