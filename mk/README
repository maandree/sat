This is a collection of generic enough makefiles.
Please feel free to use them in your project.

Usage:
	Include all.mk from your makefile.

	Read the top of each file for details.

	Define the variables:

		_VERSION
		This version of the package.

		_PROJECT
		The name of the project. Must only include [a-z0-9_-].

		_PROJECT_FULL
		The name of the project. May include any character.

		_SRC
		All source code files. This list is used when
		generating the translation template file.

		_COPYRIGHT_HOLDER
		The copyright holder's full name and e-mail address.

		COMMAND
		The name of the command. Must not be declared if
		the package does not include exactly one runnable
		command.

		PKGNAME
		The name of the package.

	Variables beginning with __ are used internally by
	the files where they appear, or in rare cases,
	internally between these files.

	Variables beginning with _ but not __ are set in the
	makefile to specify for these files how they should
	behave. They should not be changed by a user of the
	package.

	Variables that do not begin with _ are configurable
	by the user of the package.

	Do no use single character variables in your Makefile.

	To suppress pre-install, post-install, pre-uninstall,
	and post-uninstall instructions, set N=true.
	PRE_INSTALL, POST_INSTALL, PRE_UNINSTALL, and
	POST_UNINSTALL are supportered as specified by the
	GNU coding standardars.

	To figure out what pre-install commands to run in your package, run:
		 make -n a=% install | sed -e 's/\\$//' -e 's/^ *//' | sed -n '/^% /s/^..//p'

	To figure out what post-install commands to run in your package, run:
		 make -n z=% uninstall | sed -e 's/\\$//' -e 's/^ *//' | sed -n '/^% /s/^..//p'

	To figure out what pre-uninstall commands to run in your package, run:
		 make -n a=% uninstall | sed -e 's/\\$//' -e 's/^ *//' | sed -n '/^% /s/^..//p'

	To figure out what post-uninstall commands to run in your package, run:
		 make -n z=% uninstall | sed -e 's/\\$//' -e 's/^ *//' | sed -n '/^% /s/^..//p'

	To suppress verbatim which commands Make runs,
	set Q=@. (Excluding the period.)

Developers should use DEBUG=1 when running make, when possible.
