@ignore

  CROPMARKS has no effect unless HARDCOPY is set. CROPMARKS
  and AFIVEPAPER (or actually @cropmarks and @afivepaper) does
  not play well together.

  You can configure how TeX output files should look by uncommenting
  @set commands above. Do not uncomment more than one of the paper
  sizes (USLETTER, AFOURPAPER, AFIVEPAPER and SMALLBOOK); if none is
  uncomment AFOURPAPER will be set unless HARDCOPY is set, in which
  case SMALLBOOK will be set. However, if you do not want to modify
  this source file, you can run `make` with for example
  `TEXINFO_FLAGS='--texinfo="@set HARDCOPY"'`.

  Finally, you can include, on the front page, the version of sat
  that the manual is up to date with, by setting the value of VERSION
  to the version of sat, as well as date of the last update by
  setting DATE, and edition by setting EDITION. This is intended for
  printed manuals. The date is recommended to not be more accurate,
  or less accurate, than to the month. The edition should be formatted
  as, for example, ``1@sup{st}''.
