NAME
	sat - A simple implementation of at(1), with some incompatibility

DESCRIPTION
	sat is a simple implementation of at(1). But is not fully compatible
	with at(1). It is used to queue jobs to be executed later, outside
	the current controlling terminal.

	sat can also print and edit the list of queued jobs.

RATIONALE
	at(1) is far too complex.

	sat does not do natural language time parsing, it is far too complex,
	and locale dependent, for all programs to implemeent and should be
	done in a separate program.

	sat does not sanitise the environment. You have env(1) for that.
	Relaying on sat to sanitise the environment appropriately could prove
	to be a misfortune.

	sat does not do mailing because that is very restrictive, hooks are
	used instead.

ENVIRONMENY
	XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
		This environment variable names the directory in which
		interprocess communication related files are stored. If
		unset or empty, /run is used.

SEE ALSO
	at(1), cron(1), sleep-until(1)
